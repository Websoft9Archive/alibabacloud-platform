# Subscriptions

Below is the simple guide for subscriptions on AWS Marketplace:

## About

Subscription means buying, when you have completed [image deployment on AWS](/stack-deployment.md) that means you have a  subscrition for this image.

In the AWS, the image is charged by Usage Quantity the same with VM Usage Quantity:

- One the image is used on VM, the image Usage Quantity= VM Usage Quantity
- Need to cancel the image subscription, you need to delete the corresponding VM
- The VM stops running and the image stops charging
